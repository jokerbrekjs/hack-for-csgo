In this project "Hack Csgo" resources were embedded:

updates.

The resource "VAC-ByPass", i.e. the VAC-ByPass file 

These two resources, which are already embedded in "Hack Csgo" can of course be replaced by compiling the two applications mentioned and then embedding them as resources.



# Compile with Visual Studio
[Make sure that the build configuration is "Release / x86" and simply press on "Build Solution" in Visual Studio]

[Compiled application to use is in "\bin\x86\Release"]



# Previous versions
Please note that up to version 1.9 there is a file structure and it is not a single, let alone one Visual Studio project, which cannot be compiled in a simple way to use. From version 2.0 onwards, it is without a Setup Compiler and "Hack Csgo" can be easily compiled.
